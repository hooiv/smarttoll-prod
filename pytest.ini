[pytest]
# Unit tests — run from each service directory:
#   cd billing_service && pytest tests/
#   cd toll_processor  && pytest tests/
#
# Both services have a package called 'app', which prevents running them from
# the project root in a single pytest invocation without importlib isolation.
# Using the service-level 'cd ... && pytest' is the recommended approach.
#
# Integration tests (require Docker Compose — started separately):
#   pytest tests/integration/
# docker_compose_file = tests/integration/docker-compose.integration.yml
# docker_services_wait_timeout = 30
