[pytest]
# Root-level pytest.ini — shared settings only.
#
# Each service has its own pytest.ini that adds the correct pythonpath and
# testpaths.  Run tests per service:
#
#   make test                        — recommended (runs each service separately)
#   pytest billing_service/tests/    — billing unit tests only
#   pytest toll_processor/tests/     — toll processor unit tests only
#
# Running plain "pytest" from the repo root is NOT supported because both
# billing_service/app and toll_processor/app share the package name 'app'.
# A combined invocation would resolve "from app import ..." incorrectly for
# one of the two services.
#
# Integration tests (require Docker Compose — see Makefile):
#   make test-integration
